# SPIN-Seq
This repo stores some scripts used in the publication 'Single-molecule phenotyping and in-situ sequencing for mechanistic analysis of protein-DNA interactions and reactions'.
The scripts used for base calling (localization counting, base calling, confidence calculation and etc.) are in the folder 'locs_base_analysis', while extracting fluoresence intensity time profile folder and analysis for the CAP-DNA interactions are done with scripts in folder 'trace-analysis'. The preprocessing steps such as drift correction (AIM method), channel registration are in 'locs_base_analysis' as well.
It uses picasso (https://github.com/jungmannlab/picasso) as backend for localization detection & fitting. The predictive mean from a Bayesian online method (
https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.0710.3742) is used for PELT change point detection. 

Please notice that since these scripts are tailored to our experiment, parameters such as camera baseline, gain, ROI, penalty for PELT algorithm etc. need to be changed directly in the codes before they can be used in other experiments. We may provide a standalone software or napari plugin if it's a popular demand. After adjusting, they can be used just by providing the address of corresponding files such as movies in .tif format, localizations generated by Picasso in hdf5 format, and csv files.
